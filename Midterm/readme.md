<h1>Web Dev Midterm Website - <a href="http://probablynotacarrot.me/">Probably Not a Carrot</a></h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<a href="http://probablynotacarrot.me/">Probably Not a Carrot</a> is a personal website about me, Danny Wilkins.
It has four sections: About, Projects, Writeups, and Contact. Each of these sections helps give an in-depth look about me as a person and a programmer. 

<h2>The Website Building Process</h2>
<br>Naturally the website began with the sitemap, wireframe, and concept, found <a href="https://github.com/Danny-Wilkins/Web_Dev_Spring_2017/blob/master/Week_5/proposal.pdf">here</a>. Once the general idea of how the website would be laid out was there, it was just a matter of putting things into the right place. First, the nav bar was implemented, and then the rest of the site was built using a 996 grid layout. 

<h3>Home</h3>
The home page was by far the hardest and most time consuming; this is where I started from scratch. First, I implemented the nav bar; it ended up becoming a terrifying CSS rabbit hole, and I spent many hours making slight adjustments to silly things like fonts and animations. The rest of the page was also difficult because I was still figuring out how the 996 grid worked; I forgot alpha and omega were a thing so I did some hacky stuff to get things in the right place. Eventually I went back and fixed most of the ghettoness in my code. The animations and sound effects were also a pain. In the end, it was a good thing that this took so long because most of the code written on this page was reimplemented in other parts of the website. 

<h3>About</h3>
The About page didn't exist in the original site map of my website, it was just the home page. I forgot that and put it in the nav bar, and I didn't even realize until the entire website was almost done that there wasn't supposed to be an About page. As it stands now, the About page's summary is on the Home page, with much more information on the About page, including a link to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. Animation and sound code was reimplemented for the buttons. 

<h3>Projects</h3>
The Projects page is literally just a grid of buttons with brief summaries and links to the respective GitHub repositories. Again, animation and sound code from the home page was used.

<h3>Writeups</h3>
Probably the easiest to make but the hardest to fill up. Instead of Lorem Ipsum I put random crap just to make it look like hey here's what it would be like if I enjoyed writing at all.

<h3>Contact</h3>
Literally just my email. Nothing fancy. 

<h2>The Most Interesting Things</h2>
<br>
One thing that I discovered that I thought was really cool was that anything can be given a grid_num class to make it fit onto the grid. This helped prevent some really unnecessary code changing the size of things like >hr<. The animations were definitely the most difficult thing to do. In the end I got it mostly through trial and error, but having one button activate two or more animations was somewhat difficult. Oh and the glasses. The sound was the most obnoxious to get working but definitely worth. Using some really bad JavaScript, the voice of our beloved Professor Haldun graces my website. As an aside, the little red box animation on the nav bar started as an issue but I decided it looked really cool instead of just turning the whole box red.

<h2>Issues</h2>
<br>
The nav bar doesn't like to play nice with mobile or thinner screens and apparently the audio blows people's ears out if they're wearing headphones. It's less that either of these are an issue and more that I didn't find it worth my time to fix. 

<h2>What I learned</h2>
<br>
Like everything. Most of building this website was experimentation. I had a general idea of what to do but I was like wow I've never implemented any of this for real before. I think it came out really nice. Figuring out the 996 grid was definitely the most important to the clean layout. The animations are correct but I definitely could have understood what I was doing there more. The JavaScript is just meh. Overall I learned a lot though and I'm glad it came out nicely.

<h2>What I would do next</h2>
<br>
I guess I would fix the mobile support, given more time? It doesn't really matter that much to me but I guess it's possible someone could view it from their phone. Other than that I would like to figure out how to update the website more easily, like if I want to put in another project I feel like there has to be a better way than to go edit HTML and all that.
