<h2>Concept:</h2> 

A website that uses APIs to compare restaurants in a radius and return the ones that give you the best value for your money.

<h3>What's different from Yelp or similar services?</h3>

Yelp simply returns values like price ($$, $$$$, etc.) and rating (x/5 stars). Bytes uses a PROPRIETARY LINEAR REGRESSION FORMULA TO no it just takes the average price to value graph, and any restaurants with a ratio above that are a good value, anything below is a bad value.
