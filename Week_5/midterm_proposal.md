<h2>Concept:</h2> 

A website to showcase projects, documentation/writeups, and other things about various project related activities. 

<h2>Presentation: </h2>

https://github.com/Danny-Wilkins/Web_Dev_Spring_2017/blob/master/Week_5/proposal.pdf

<h2>Existing website: </h2>

https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/

<h2>Skills: </h2>

Navbar, links, images, page formatting using divs, etc. 

<h2>Still need to learn: </h2>

Maybe like an endless scrolling thing so the page can get longer automatically, not that I have that much content.
