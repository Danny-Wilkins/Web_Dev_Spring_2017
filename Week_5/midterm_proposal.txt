Concept: A website to showcase projects, documentation/writeups, and other things about various project related activities. 

Presentation: 

Existing website: https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/

Skills: Navbar, links, images, page formatting using divs, etc. 

Still need to learn: Maybe like an endless scrolling thing so the page can get longer automatically, not that I have that much content.
